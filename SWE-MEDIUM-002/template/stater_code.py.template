# PVLib Golden Section Search Parameter Validation Fix

## Project Background

**{{library_name}}** is a Python library for photovoltaic energy system modeling used by solar energy researchers and engineers. The library performs complex simulations of solar panel performance under various environmental conditions.

## Issue Description

{{use_case_scenario}}

Since version 0.9.4, the library introduced stricter parameter validation in the `_golden_sect_DataFrame` function used for optimization. This validation now fails when processing real-world photovoltaic data that contains very small negative values due to numerical precision issues.

### The Problem

The current validation logic:
```python
if np.any(upper - lower < 0.):
    raise ValueError('upper >= lower is required')
```

This validation is too strict and causes simulation failures when encountering:

- Very low effective irradiance values (e.g., `1.341083e-17` at sunrise/sunset)
- Small negative `v_oc` (open-circuit voltage) values close to machine precision
- Arrays like: `[-8.43546518e-15, 9.46949758e-16, ...]`

## Impact
- Bifacial solar panel simulations crash with `ValueError: upper >= lower is required`
- Large-scale daily solar analysis workflows fail due to edge cases
- Previously working code breaks after library upgrade

### Your Task
Fix the parameter validation in the `_golden_sect_DataFrame` function to handle numerical precision edge cases while maintaining algorithmic correctness.

### Requirements
1. Maintain API compatibility - Don't change function signatures
2. Handle edge cases gracefully - Allow for small numerical precision errors
3. Preserve correctness - Golden section search must still work for normal cases
4. Reject invalid inputs - Still catch genuinely invalid parameter combinations

### Implementation Guidelines
Consider these approaches:
- Use tolerance-based validation instead of strict inequality
- Handle very small negative values that are likely numerical noise
- Distinguish between meaningful bound violations vs precision artifacts
- Log warnings for edge cases using {{log_level}} level logging
    
### Files to Modify
- `tools.py` - Contains the `_golden_sect_DataFrame` function that needs fixing
- `test_tools.py` - Add comprehensive tests for your fix

### Key Considerations
- What constitutes "slightly negative" vs "genuinely invalid"?
- How to balance numerical robustness with mathematical correctness?
- When to raise errors vs handle gracefully vs log warnings?

### Expected Outcome
After your fix:

- Solar simulations with edge case irradiance values should complete successfully
- Normal optimization cases should continue working without changes
- Invalid parameter combinations should still raise appropriate errors
- Edge cases should be handled transparently with optional logging
Your solution will help solar energy researchers process complete daily irradiance datasets without manual filtering of numerical edge cases.
